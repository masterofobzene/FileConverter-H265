# File Converter

## Description
**File Converter (H265)** is a very simple tool which allows you to convert and compress one or several file(s) using the context menu of windows explorer. This fork replaces the H264 codec with the more efficient H265 codec to get up to %50 video file size reduction with same quality. 

Original project (non H265 compatible) can be downloaded here: [file-converter github](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter).

You can find more information about what's in File converter and how to use it on the [wiki](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter/wiki). (should be the same for this version too)
